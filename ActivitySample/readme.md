# ActivitySample

## Introduce.
This app has four activities(MainActivity, SecondActivity, ThirdActivity, FourthActivity).<br>
Let's start with the main activity.

## Test.
I wanted to check the activity backstack through a test.<br>
So I used the "dumpsys" command.

### Case 1. No option

Scenario: Main -> Second -> Third -> Fourth -> Main<br>
